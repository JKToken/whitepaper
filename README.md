# JK Token: A Memecoin Built on the BNB Chain
**Whitepaper Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** December 10th, 2025  
**Location:** New York

## 1. Introduction

JK Token is a memecoin built on the BNB Chain and named after John Kwok, the founder of Pegora. The core properties of the memecoin are defined by its deployment parameters, and participants may refer to on-chain data to understand its structure, distribution, and circulation. This document provides a formal description of JK Token’s essential characteristics and operational logic.

## 2. Overview

- **Name:** JK Token  
- **Symbol:** JKT  
- **Blockchain:** BNB Chain  
- **Standard:** BEP-20
- **Contract Address:** 0xc7dbaeabf773a9bfd20ea085061d52cf4faa4444
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000

JK Token is a standard BEP-20 memecoin deployed on the BNB Chain. Its characteristics and operational rules are entirely defined by the on-chain smart contract and recorded transparently on the blockchain. The structure and attributes of the token can be verified through publicly accessible on-chain data.

## 3. Issuance Method

JK Token was deployed through Four.meme. All parameters related to its initial creation, supply configuration, and other issuance characteristics are determined by the deployed contract and fully reflected on the blockchain. Any minting or burning mechanisms defined within the contract are executed automatically, and participants may verify all details through blockchain explorers.

## 4. Operational Model

The operation of JK Token relies solely on the logic encoded in its smart contract. All token properties, state variables, and structural mechanisms function in a decentralized manner on the blockchain, with full transparency and verifiability. The rules governing the token are strictly determined by the contract’s parameters and do not rely on external or centralized control.

## 5. Legal Compliance and Regional Restrictions

JK Token may be subject to cryptocurrency regulations in certain jurisdictions. Users located in regions with strict regulatory frameworks should ensure compliance with local laws before acquiring or using the memecoin. Any legal responsibilities arising from the use of the token are borne solely by the individual. Participation is entirely voluntary and at the user’s own risk.

## 6. Risk Disclosure

On-chain memecoins may experience price volatility, liquidity uncertainty, contract vulnerabilities, and fluctuations in market participation. All decisions involving the token are made independently by participants, who assume full responsibility for their actions. This whitepaper does not constitute investment advice and makes no guarantees regarding the token’s value or future performance.

## 7. Conclusion

JK Token functions as an on-chain memecoin whose characteristics, behavior, and circulation are fully determined by its deployed smart contract. All activity occurs transparently on the BNB Chain, enabling participants to verify relevant information through on-chain records. This whitepaper provides a structural overview of the token, while the smart contract and blockchain data remain the sole authoritative references for all participants.
